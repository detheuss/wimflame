    <Heading2>Is Wimflame on Google Play?</Heading2>
    <Paragraph>
      Wimflame is a modern, open-source project that meets the
      <span class="font-bold">Progressive Web App (PWA) requirements</span>,
      which allows it to be installed directly from the browser. I could publish it to Google
      Play, but as a solo developer with limited time, Iâ€™ve prioritized building
      the app itself.
    </Paragraph>

    <Heading2>Is Installing Wimflame Safe?</Heading2>
    <Paragraph>
      Yes â€” installing Wimflame from your browser is completely safe. It's an
      open-source project, meaning the entire codebase is publicly available and
      transparent. You can see it for yourself.
